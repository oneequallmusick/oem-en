Founded in 2011, Montreal-based One Equall Musick is a collaborative vocal ensemble dedicated to the programming and interpretation of high quality repertoire from the fifteenth-century to the present day. OEM has appeared in the Montreal Bach Festival alongside celebrated organist Hans-Ola Ericsson and in Lennoxville, QC as part of the Uplands Musical Society Concert Series. The ensemble maintains a strong interest in historical performance practice and scholarship and has produced both a concert and archival recording of little-known works for mens' voices from the Wanley and Lumley manuscripts; OEM has also worked with the McGill Centre for Research on Religion to present a series of historical Evensong services at Birks Chapel. OEM enjoys collaborating with other ensembles and has shared the stage with the medieval vocal ensemble Scholastica, Compagnie Baroque Mont-Royal, the Syrian music group Ensemble Zaman, and Ensemble Séfarade et Méditerannéan.
