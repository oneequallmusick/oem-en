Montreal-based One Equall Musick is a collaborative vocal ensemble dedicated to the programming and interpretation of high quality repertoire from the fifteenth-century to the present day. Founded in 2011, the ensemble has presented many concerts in the Montreal area including a series of historical Evensong services at Birks Chapel in collaboration with the McGill Centre for Research on Religion. One Equall Musick was featured in the 2013 Montreal Bach Festival alongside celebrated organist Hans-Ola Ericsson; performed in Lennoxville, QC as part of the 2013 Uplands Musical Society Concert Series; and has appeared in two operas and an oratorio with the Compagnie Baroque Mont-Royal. Upcoming projects include a collaboration with medieval music ensemble Scholastica, directed by Rebecca Bain; a performance of English motets from the Wanley and Lumley manuscripts, including the famous “If You Love Me” by Thomas Tallis; and a portrait of fifteenth-century Spain exploring the music of Arabic, Jewish and Christian cultures.
