    "Le rossignol d'est en ouest" is a collaboration between One Equall Musick and Lebanese singer Lamia Yared, celebrating the nightingale as a source of musical and literary inspiration in European and Middle Eastern traditions. The program includes selections from the 1597 publication <i>Le Rossignol Musical des Chansons</i> and other Renaissance works celebrating birdsong, alongside examples of <i>Muwashah</i>, an elaborate Arabic form of singing poetry; selections from the Turkish classical repertoire; and Sephardic song. The musical program will be punctuated by poetry and prose readings, while the sound of recorded birdsong and lighting effects recreate the nocturnal atmosphere of the nightingaleâ€™s famous song.
