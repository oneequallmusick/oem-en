  Duo concert featuring two up-and-coming Montréal ensembles. One Equall Musick transports us to 17th-century Lübeck, while Earth World presents an immersive concert for an imaginary underwater organ. Presented by the CIOC.</p><p>7 pm : One Equall Musick (Abendmusilk)<br />8 pm : Cocktail<br />9 pm : Collectif Earth World (Musique pour l'hydroörganon)</p><p>Abendmusik ("Evening Music") refers to Sunday evening concerts given in the Marienkirche in Lübeck throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.  Dietrich Buxtehude, organist at Lübeck from 1668-1707, inherited this tradition from his predecessor Franz Tunder and turned it into a high profile and popular series on the five Sundays before Christmas. Organist Mark McDonald and One Equall Musick will perform choral and instrumental works by Buxtehude in the Abendmusik tradition.
