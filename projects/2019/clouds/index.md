description: >
  "Concert in the Clouds" is a concert in praise of clouds. Clouds are ephemeral and  intangible; they shape-shift, fade away, and emerge out of nowhere; they can be awe-inspiring and sublime. And likewise with music. One poet has said that "Architecture is frozen music". For us, clouds are living music. Clouds are music you can see but can’t hear and music is a cloud you can hear but can’t see.
